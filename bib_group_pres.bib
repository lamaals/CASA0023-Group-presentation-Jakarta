  abstract = {Land subsidence is natural-anthropogenic hazard affecting several large urban areas in Indonesia, i.e. Jakarta, Bandung and Semarang. Geodetic based results from various techniques (e.g. Leveling, GPS and InSAR) show that land subsidence rates in all three cities generally have spatial and temporal variations, and their magnitude is in average about 5-10 cm/year and can reach up to about 20 cm/year at certain locations and times. This type of silent hazard is mainly caused by the combination of excessive groundwater extraction, natural consolidation of alluvium soil, load of constructions and tectonic activities. In general, information related to characteristics of land subsidence is important for urban spatial planning and development activities, environmental management, and risk assessment efforts. Therefore, systematic and continuous monitoring of land subsidence in urban areas is obviously needed and critical to the welfare of the peoples. Land subsidence impacts in urban areas are quite numerous and can be categorized into infrastructural, environmental, economic and social impacts. In urban areas of Indonesia the subsidence impacts can be seen already in the field in forms of cracking and damage of housing, buildings and infrastructure; wider expansion of (riverine and coastal) flooding areas, malfunction of drainage system, changes in river canal and drain flow systems and increased inland sea water intrusion. In general, land subsidence phenomena will increase the maintenance and rehabilitation costs for the affected environment, buildings and infrastructures. It also badly influences the quality of living environment (e.g. health and sanitation condition) and (social and economic) life in the affected areas. This paper concentrates on the environmental impacts of land subsidence in those three large cities in Indonesia, namely Jakarta, Bandung and Semarang.},

  abstract = {Jakarta is the capital city of Indonesia with a population of about 9.6 million people, inhabiting an area of about 660 square-km. In the last three decades, urban development of Jakarta has grown very rapidly in the sectors of industry, trade, transportation, real estate, and many others. This exponentially increased urban development introduces several environmental problems. Land subsidence is one of them. The resulted land subsidence will also then affect the urban development plan and process. It has been reported for many years that several places in Jakarta are subsiding at different rates. The leveling surveys, GPS survey methods, and InSAR measurements have been used to study land subsidence in Jakarta, over the period of 1982--2010. In general, it was found that the land subsidence exhibits spatial and temporal variations, with the rates of about 1--15~cm/year. A few locations can have the subsidence rates up to about 20--28~cm/year. There are four different types of land subsidence that can be expected to occur in the Jakarta basin, namely: subsidence due to groundwater extraction, subsidence induced by the load of constructions (i.e., settlement of high compressibility soil), subsidence caused by natural consolidation of alluvial soil, and tectonic subsidence. It was found that the spatial and temporal variations of land subsidence depend on the corresponding variations of groundwater extraction, coupled with the characteristics of sedimentary layers and building loads above it. In general, there is strong relation between land subsidence and urban development activities in Jakarta.},

  abstract = {Jakarta is the capital city of Indonesia located in the west-northern coast of Java island, within a deltaic plain and passes by 13 natural and artificial rivers. This megapolitan has a population of about 10.2 million people inhabiting an area of about 660 km2, with relatively rapid urban development. It has been reported for many years that several places in Jakarta are subsiding at different rates. The main causative factors of land subsidence in Jakarta are most probably excessive groundwater extraction, load of constructions (i.e., settlement of high compressibility soil), and natural consolidation of alluvial soil. Land subsidence in Jakarta has been studied using leveling surveys, GPS surveys, InSAR and Geometric-Historic techniques. The results obtained from leveling surveys, GPS surveys and InSAR technique over the period between 1974 and 2010 show that land subsidence in Jakarta has spatial and temporal variations with typical rates of about 3--10 cm year-1. Rapid urban development, relatively young alluvium soil, and relatively weak mitigation and adapatation initiatives, are risk increasing factors of land subsidence in Jakarta. The subsidence impacts can be seen already in the field in forms of cracking and damage of housing, buildings and infrastructure; wider expansion of (riverine and coastal) flooding areas, malfunction of drainage system, changes in river canal and drain flow systems and increased inland sea water intrusion. These impacts can be categorized into infrastructural, environmental, economic and social impacts. The risk and impacts of land subsidence in Jakarta and their related aspects are discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {The global sea-level rise (SLR) projections for the next few decades are the basis for developing flooding maps that depict the expected hazard scenarios. However, the spatially variable land subsidence has generally not been considered in the current projections. In this study, we use geodetic data from global navigation satellite system (GNSS), synthetic aperture radar interferometric measurements (InSAR) and sea-level data from tidal stations to show the combined effects of land subsidence and SLR along the coast between Catania and Marzamemi, in south-eastern Sicily (southern Italy). This is one of the most active tectonic areas of the Mediterranean basin, which drives accelerated SLR, continuous coastal retreat and increasing effects of flooding and storms surges. We focus on six selected areas, which show valuable coastal infrastructures and natural reserves where the expected SLR in the next few years could be a potential cause of significant land flooding and morphological changes of the coastal strip. Through a multidisciplinary study, the multi-temporal flooding scenarios until 2100, have been estimated. Results are based on the spatially variable rates of vertical land movements (VLM), the topographic features of the area provided by airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of SLR in the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. In addition, from the analysis of the time series of optical satellite images, a coastal retreat up to 70 m has been observed at the Ciane river mouth (Siracusa) in the time span 2001--2019. Our results show a diffuse land subsidence locally exceeding 10 {\textpm} 2.5 mm/year in some areas, due to compacting artificial landfill, salt marshes and Holocene soft deposits. Given ongoing land subsidence, a high end of RSLR in the RCP 8.5 at 0.52 {\textpm} 0.05 m and 1.52 {\textpm} 0.13 m is expected for 2050 AD and 2100 AD, respectively, with an exposed area of about 9.7 km2 that will be vulnerable to inundation in the next 80 years.},

While geocentric (eustatic) SLR receives widespread attention in politics and media, relative SLR at the coast, mainly caused by land subsidence, is still comparatively under-researched despite much higher rates. This paper introduces a combined natural and social science study to bring subsidence more to the forefront of coastal hazard research. We use data from radar altimetry, GNSS controlled tide gauge stations, and InSAR mapping to characterize regional and relative SLR at Jakarta and Semarang Bay, and focus-group discussions and a standardized household survey to analyze risk perceptions and adaptation. Our analysis of InSAR, radar altimetry, and corrected tide gauges clearly identifies subsidence as the major coastal threat in our study areas. The InSAR analysis for Semarang shows stable trends of subsidence up to {\textasciitilde}100 mm/a. For Jakarta, our analysis reveals more complex spatial and temporal patterns with rates around 60 mm/a; revealing significant changes to previous studies. Our analysis of radar altimetry data since 1993 shows a moderate regional SLR of 2.1 mm/a off Semarang and 3.2 mm/a off Jakarta. The InSAR data are integrated into our statistical analysis of household responses towards subsidence. We found, that in contrast to fast-onset events, constantly proceeding subsidence becomes normalized in peoples' perceptions and responses are integrated into day-to-day habits. Thus, risk perception is a far lesser determinant of responses towards subsidence than it is for fast-onset events. Hence, our results relativize former assumptions that risk perception and not actual exposure lead to action. Moreover, we found that local people are not willing to vacate highly exposed areas.

In this paper, we focus on the Konya region, one of the leading economic centers in the agricultural and industrial sectors in Turkey. We present a multi-source data approach aimed at investigating the complex and fragile environment of this area which is heavily affected by groundwater drawdown and ground subsidence. In particular, in order to analyze the spatial and temporal pattern of the subsidence process we use the Small BAseline Subset DInSAR technique to process two datasets of ENVISAT SAR images spanning the 2002--2010 period. The produced ground deformation maps and associated time-series allow us to detect a wide land subsidence extending for about 1200 km2 and measure vertical displacements reaching up to 10 cm in the observed time interval. DInSAR results, complemented with climatic, stratigraphic and piezometric data as well as with land-cover changes information, allow us to give more insights on the impact of climate changes and human activities on groundwater resources depletion and land subsidence.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of marine trade, marine oil pollution is becoming increasingly severe, which can exert damage to the health of the marine environment. Therefore, detection of marine oil spills is important for effectively starting the oil-spill cleaning process and the protection of the marine environment. The polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) technique has been applied to the detection of marine oil spills in recent years. However, most current studies still focus on using the simple intensity or amplitude information of SAR data and the detection results are not reliable enough. This paper presents a deep-learning-based method to detect oil spills on the marine surface from Sentinel-1 PolSAR satellite images. Specifically, attention gates are added to the U-Net network architecture, which ensures that the model focuses more on feature extraction. In the training process of the model, sufficient Sentinel-1 PolSAR images are selected as sample data. The polarimetric information from the PolSAR dataset and the wind-speed information of the marine surface are both taken into account when training the model and detecting oil spills. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the traditional methods, and taking into account both the polarimetric and wind-speed information, can indeed improve the oil-spill detection results. In addition, the model shows pleasing performance in capturing the fine details of the boundaries of the oil-spill patches.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the utilization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for monitoring and detection of oil spills. In this work, a case study of an oil spill has been investigated using C-band Sentinel-1A SAR data to detect the oil spill that occurred on 28 January 2017, near Ennore port, Chennai, India. Oil spill damages marine ecosystems causing serious environmental effects. Quite often, oil spills on the sea/ocean surface are seen nowadays, mainly in major shipping routes. They are caused due to tanker collisions, illegal discharge from the ships, etc. An oil spill can be monitored and detected using various platforms such as vessel-based, airborne-based and satellite-based. Vessel based and airborne methods are expensive with less area coverage. This process also consumes more time. For ocean applications such as oil spill and Ship detection, optical sensors cannot image during bad weather. As SAR is an active sensor, weather independent, and has cloud penetrating capability, the images can be acquired during the day as well as at night. Radar Remote Sensing (RRS) has rapidly gained popularity for monitoring and detection of oil spills and ships for more than a decade. With the availability of the satellite images, detection of oil spill has improved due to its wide coverage and less revisit time. The present paper gives an overview of the methodologies used to detect oil spills on the SAR images using dual-pol Sentinel-1A Level 1 SLC data. This work clearly demonstrates the preprocessing steps of the Sentinel 1A data for oil spill detection. The oil spill was only visible in the VV channel, therefore, for ocean application VV channel image is preferred. SEASAT was the first space-borne SAR mission launched in 1978 by NASA to observe sea surface. The preprocessing was carried out at the European Space Agency (ESA), the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) toolbox and Envi 5.1 toolbox. Based on the Sigma naught values, oil spill can be discriminated with the ocean surface. The results obtained with the VV channel are satisfactory and one could map out the oil spill very well. Supervised classifiers SVM and NN were applied on the boxcar filtered 3~{\texttimes}~3 VV channel image to delineate the oil spill. The result of oil spill detection mapping is validated with Supervised SVM and Neural Network classifiers. The results show there is a good agreement between oil spill mapping and classified image using SVM and NN classified images. The Overall Accuracy (OA) obtained using SVM classifier is 98.13\% with kappa coefficient as 0.95 and using NN classifier is 98.11\% with kappa coefficients 0.95. This technique is considered to be a potential proxy for the detection and monitoring of Oil spills on water bodies. Application of SAR data for oil spill detection is considered to be first of its kind from Indian coasts. This study aims to detect the oil spill occurred due to collision of two LPG tankers with Sentinel-1A SLC data in Chennai coast area.},

  abstract = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetric datasets are widely used in the detection and classification of urban areas. Most methods used today are based on the decomposition of fully polarimetric SAR data, which allows for the extraction of physical information about the nature of the medium and the application of proper classification methods. According to the theory, the main and predominant backscattering mechanism for buildings is double bounce. However, when analyzing urban environments, the observed predominant backscatter may differ from theory depending on many aspects. In this paper, we analyze fully polarimetric ALOS PALSAR data for various cities located on different continents, proving that the theory does not hold for most cases. There are many factors that have an impact on the detected backscatter mechanism, and the theoretical principle of predominant double bounce in urban areas can be met only under specific conditions. These factors are, among others, the orientation of the buildings, the dimensions of the streets, the type of construction (i.e., numerous planes on the roof), etc. This paper also mentions the canonical example of San Francisco, widely analyzed in the literature, as a case showing the impact of building deorientation on double bounce scattering. This area of interest is also discussed in terms of the impact of SAR data resolution on the detection of specific backscatter mechanisms. The findings of this work are very useful for increasing the awareness of the utilization of classification approaches where only pixels with double bounce backscatter mechanisms are classified as urban areas. Moreover, the article lists factors that should be taken into consideration when performing urban area detection based only on polarimetric data and standard algorithms, such as street and building orientation, building heights, and structures.},

  abstract = {Coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, provide key ecosystem services for climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, combined anthropogenic activities and climatic change-driven sea level rise (SLR) pose a severe threat to their global persistence, and to the continued delivery of these services. Mangrove vulnerability to SLR depends upon capacity for both resilience (landward migration) and resistance (maintained functioning with the existing distribution), which are in turn hindered by extractive activities and coastal infrastructure development. Limited landscape-scale data availability means existing SLR vulnerability assessment frameworks lack rigorous quantification of these discrete processes. Here we develop and implement a novel multi-product (multispectral, microwave, derived-product) open-access satellite remote sensing approach to assess both coastal ecosystem SLR resilience and resistance capacity in multiple mangrove sites across the world, and landscape-level and anthropogenic factors driving these capacities. Our approach allows comparative ranking of resilience and resistance capacities across sites, based on relative observed ecosystem change (biomass, distribution) and in constraints to these two components of SLR vulnerability. We observe mostly low SLR resilience and resistance across our case study sites. Furthermore, we find that site-specific resilience and resistance capacities and constraints can be highly incongruent, highlighting the importance of comprehensive SLR vulnerability monitoring for effective management. High within-site variation was also detected in resilience and resistance capacities and their constraints. This underlines the importance of spatially explicit monitoring at extensive spatial scales to inform decision making. The methodology developed and repeat-pass imagery employed adds to the remote monitoring and assessment toolkit for adaptive coastal ecosystem management under SLR, providing a new approach to inform conservation and management priority assessments in data-deficient regions.},

  abstract = {Conventional change detection approaches are mainly based on per-pixel processing, which ignore the sub-pixel spectral variation resulted from spectral mixture. Especially for medium-resolution remote sensing images used in urban land-cover change monitoring, land use/cover components within a single pixel are usually complicated and heterogeneous due to the limitation of the spatial resolution. Thus, traditional hard detection methods based on pure pixel assumption may lead to a high level of omission and commission errors inevitably, degrading the overall accuracy of change detection. In order to address this issue and find a possible way to exploit the spectral variation in a sub-pixel level, a novel change detection scheme is designed based on the spectral mixture analysis and decision-level fusion. Nonlinear spectral mixture model is selected for spectral unmixing, and change detection is implemented in a sub-pixel level by investigating the inner-pixel subtle changes and combining multiple composition evidences. The proposed method is tested on multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper and China--Brazil Earth Resources Satellite remote sensing images for the land-cover change detection over urban areas. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed in terms of several accuracy indices in contrast with two pixel-based change detection methods (i.e. change vector analysis and principal component analysis-based method). In particular, the proposed sub-pixel change detection approach not only provides the binary change information, but also obtains the characterization about change direction and intensity, which greatly extends the semantic meaning of the detected change targets.},

  abstract = {Given the importance of accuracy in land cover (LC) maps, several methods have been adopted to predict per-pixel land cover accuracy (PLCA) of classified remote sensing images. Such a PLCA map provides spatially-explicit accuracy information and is of paramount importance for both producers and end-users of LC maps to thoroughly understand the spatial distribution of accuracy. In this study, we proposed a simple yet powerful random forest (RF) based approach for PLCA mapping with limited reference sample data. The main assumption of the proposed approach is that the LC's misclassifications do not occur randomly, but rather exhibit some detectable characteristics which can be retrieved via the built model. With this approach, RF attempts to establish a nonlinear relationship between the accuracy and the same spectral bands used in LC classification. To confirm the proposed method as a consistent and practical approach for a variety of different settings, we evaluated it on five different classified remote sensing images derived from Landsat-8, Ikonos, and three Sentinel-2 images across different parts of Iran. In this manner, to validate the predictive capability of the RF-based method, we calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and several other statistical metrics, including sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (ACC). Analysis of the average values of these metrics (AUROC~=~0.88, SN~=~95\%, SP~=~68\%, PPV~=~96\%, NPV~=~72\%, and ACC~=~95\%) derived from the limited sample size datasets showed that the proposed model performs well in all case studies. The performance of the proposed model was further assessed through comparison against two benchmark methods, namely Gaussian kernel interpolation (GKI) and linear kernel interpolation (LKI). In conclusion, although our comprehensive evaluations revealed that RF, GKI, and LKI methods are promising approaches for PLCA mapping, RF outperformed both GKI and LKI in all of the experimental sites.},

To mitigate the damages caused by LS, it is necessary to determine the LS-prone areas. In this paper, LS susceptibility was assessed for Kashan Plain in Iran using Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost machine learning algorithms. For the susceptibility analysis, twelve influential factors including elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), groundwater drawdown (GWD), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to stream (DtS), distance to road (DtR), distance to fault (DtF), lithology, and land use were taken into account. 291 LS points were used in this study which was divided into two parts of 70\% and 30\% for training and testing the models, respectively. The prediction power of the models and their produced LS susceptibility maps (LSSMs) were validated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R-Squared (R2), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values. The results showed that the XGBoost had a higher R{$^2$} equal to 0.9032 compared to that of the RF which was equal to 0.8355. XGBoost model had an RMSE equal to 0.3764 cm compared to that of the RF model which was equal to 0.4906 cm. MAE for the XGBoost model was 0.1217 cm and for the RF model was 0.3050 cm. Therefore, the achieved results proved that XGBoost had better performance in this research for predicting LS values based on the measured ones.},

  abstract = {Mapping informal settlements is crucial for resource and utility management and planning. In 2003, the UN-Habitat developed a process for mapping and monitoring urban inequality to support reporting against the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Informal settlement indicators are used as a framework to carry out image analysis, and include vegetation extent, lacunarity of housing structures / vacant land, road segment type and materials, texture measures of built-up areas, roofing extent of built-up areas and dwelling size. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods are recommended to identify informal settlements. This paper documents the application of OBIA to map informal settlements, drawing on the ontology of Kohli et al. (2012) and the indicators of Owen and Wong (2013) for a Middle Eastern city. Three informal settlements with different land use histories were selected to represent old and new informal settlements in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Vegetation extent was the most successful indicator detected, with 100\% producer accuracy and over 84\% user accuracy, followed by the road network, with 84\% producer and user accuracies in older informal settlements and 73\% producer accuracy and 96\% user accuracy across all case studies. Lacunarity of housing structures / vacant land was detected well in informal settlements. The texture measure indicator was detected using GLCMEnt(R) with low producer accuracy across all case studies. The roofing extent of the built-up area is detected with better producer and user accuracies than texture measures. The dwellings size indicator generally failed to distinguish formal from informal settlements. Informal and formal were distinguished with an overall accuracy of 83\%. This research concludes that OBIA is a useful method to map informal settlement indicators in Middle Eastern cities. However, a generic ruleset for mapping informal settlements remains elusive, and each indicator requires significant localised `tuning'.},

  abstract = {Mu Us Sandy Land is a typical semi-arid vulnerable ecological zone, characterized by vegetation degradation and severe desertification. Effectively identifying desertification changes has been a topical environmental issue in China. However, most previous studies have used a single method or remote sensing index to monitor desertification, and lacked an efficient and high-precision monitoring system. In this study, an optimal monitoring scheme that considers multiple indicators combination and different machine learning methods (Classification and Regression Tree-Decision Tree, CART-DT; Random Forest, RF; Convolutional Neural Networks, CNN) was developed and used to analyze the spatial--temporal patterns of desertification from 2000 to 2018 in Mu Us Sandy Land. The results showed that: (a) The random forest model performed best for monitoring desertification based on medium and low-resolution remote sensing images, and the four-index combination (Albedo, NDVI, LST and TGSI) obtained the highest classification accuracy (OA = 87.67\%) in Mu Us Sandy Land. Surprisingly, the model accuracy of the three-index combination (NDVI, LST and TGSI) (OA = 85.74\%) is comparable to the four-index combination. (b) The TGSI index used to characterize soil information performs well, while the LST is not conducive to the extraction of desertified land in several desertification monitoring indicators. (c) Since 2000, the area of extremely severe desertified land has shown a reversal trend; however, there is significant interannual fluctuation in the total and light desertification land area affected by extreme climate. This research provides a novel approach and a valuable reference for monitoring the evolution of desertification in regional studies, and the results improve the research system of desertification and provide a data basis for desertification cause analysis and prevention.},

  abstract = {Sea Surface Temperature is a variable recognized as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observation System (GCOS), due to its determinant influence on climate dynamics, from micro scale to global levels The aim of this paper is to estimate Sea Surface Temperature trends in the Mediterranean Sea during years 2003--2019 by using the MODIS Level 3 SST Thermal IR 8 Day 4km V2019.0. Results show an SST increase of 0.040~{\textpm}~0.001 {$^\circ$}C/yr. The seasonal maximum trend is associated to summer 0.070~{\textpm}~0.001 {$^\circ$}C/yr, followed by winter, (0.040~{\textpm}~0.001) {$^\circ$}C/yr, autumn 0.030~{\textpm}~0.001 {$^\circ$}C/yr and spring, 0.020~{\textpm}~0.001 {$^\circ$}C/yr. The total period analyzed has been divided into ten-year time spans, showing a stable increase of 0.055 {$^\circ$}C/yr in average, from period 2005--2014 onwards. In absolute SST values terms, the parameter range is of 0.85{$^\circ$}C from year 2005 to 2019. We have also analyzed the spatial variability of the parameter by dividing the Mediterranean Sea into nine sub-basins: Alboran Sea, Balearic Sea (Iberian Sea), Mediterranean Western Basin, Mediterranean Eastern Basin, Ligurian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea and Aegean Sea. The results show warming trends from 0.02 {$^\circ$}C/yr for the Alboran Sea to 0.07{$^\circ$}C/yr for the Adriatic Sea. Results have been validated by using data from a local observational buoy system, obtaining a coefficient of determination of 0.97.},

  abstract = {Elevation data are critical for assessments of sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal flooding exposure. Previous research has demonstrated that the quality of data used in elevation-based assessments must be well understood and applied to properly model potential impacts. The cumulative vertical uncertainty of the input elevation data substantially controls the minimum increments of SLR and the minimum planning horizons that can be effectively used in assessments. For regional, continental, or global assessments, several digital elevation models (DEMs) are available for the required topographic information to project potential impacts of increased coastal water levels, whether a simple inundation model is used or a more complex process-based or probabilistic model is employed. When properly characterized, the vertical accuracy of the DEM can be used to report assessment results with the uncertainty stated in terms of a specific confidence level or likelihood category. An accuracy evaluation has been conducted of global DEMs to quantify their inherent vertical uncertainty to demonstrate how accuracy information should be considered when planning and implementing a SLR or coastal flooding assessment. The evaluation approach includes comparison of the DEMs with high-accuracy geodetic control points as the independent reference data over a variety of coastal relief settings. The global DEMs evaluated include SRTM, ASTER GDEM, ALOS World 3D, TanDEM-X, NASADEM, and MERIT. High-resolution, high-accuracy DEM sources, such as airborne lidar and stereo imagery, are also included to give context to the results from the global DEMs. The accuracy characterization results show that current global DEMs are not adequate for high confidence mapping of exposure to fine increments ({$<$}1 m) of SLR or with shorter planning horizons ({$<$}100 years) and thus they should not be used for such mapping, but they are suitable for general delineation of low elevation coastal zones. In addition to the best practice of rigorous accounting for vertical uncertainty, other recommended procedures are presented for delineation of different types of impact areas (marine and groundwater inundation) and use of regional relative SLR scenarios. The requirement remains for a freely available, high-accuracy, high-resolution global elevation model that supports quantitative SLR and coastal inundation assessments at high confidence levels.},

  abstract = {Most published studies identify groundwater extraction as the leading cause of land subsidence (LS). However, the causes of LS are not only attributable to groundwater extraction. Other land-use practices can also affect the occurrence of LS. In this study, radar interferometric techniques and machine learning (ML) models were used for the prediction, susceptibility zoning, and prioritization of influential variables in the occurrence of LS in the Bakhtegan basin. The LS rate was characterized by applying an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). The recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was used to detect and select the dominant combination of indicators to prepare an LS susceptibility map. Three ML models, including random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and classification and regression trees (CART), were used to develop predictive models. All three models had acceptable performance. Among the ML models, the RF model performed the best (i.e., Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency, Kling--Gupta efficiency, correlation coefficient, and percent bias metrics of 0.76, 0.78, 0.88, and 0.70 for validating phase, respectively). The analysis conducted on all three ML model outputs showed that high and very high LS susceptibility classes were located on or near irrigated agricultural land. The results indicate that the leading cause of land LS in the study region is not due to groundwater withdrawals. Instead, the distance from dams and the proximity to anticlines, faults, and mines are the most important identifiers of LS susceptibility. Additionally, the highest probability of LS susceptibility was found at distances less than 18 km from synclines, 6 to 13 km from anticlines, 23 km from dams, and distances less than 20 to more than 144 km from mines. The validated methods presented in this study are reproducible, transferrable, and recommended for mapping LS susceptibility in semiarid and arid climate zones with similar environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Image segmentation is a critical and important step in (GEographic) Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA or OBIA). The final feature extraction and classification in OBIA is highly dependent on the quality of image segmentation. Segmentation has been used in remote sensing image processing since the advent of the Landsat-1 satellite. However, after the launch of the high-resolution IKONOS satellite in 1999, the paradigm of image analysis moved from pixel-based to object-based. As a result, the purpose of segmentation has been changed from helping pixel labeling to object identification. Although several articles have reviewed segmentation algorithms, it is unclear if some segmentation algorithms are generally more suited for (GE)OBIA than others. This article has conducted an extensive state-of-the-art survey on OBIA techniques, discussed different segmentation techniques and their applicability to OBIA. Conceptual details of those techniques are explained along with the strengths and weaknesses. The available tools and software packages for segmentation are also summarized. The key challenge in image segmentation is to select optimal parameters and algorithms that can general image objects matching with the meaningful geographic objects. Recent research indicates an apparent movement towards the improvement of segmentation algorithms, aiming at more accurate, automated, and computationally efficient techniques.},

  abstract = {Many cities in the global South are facing the emergence and growth of highly dynamic slum areas, but often lack detailed information on these developments. Available statistical data are commonly aggregated to large, heterogeneous administrative units that are geographically meaningless for informing effective pro-poor policies. General base information neither allows spatially disaggregated analysis of deprived areas nor monitoring of rapidly changing settlement dynamics, which characterize slums. This paper explores the utility of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) variance to distinguish between slums and formal built-up (formal) areas in very high spatial and spectral resolution satellite imagery such as WorldView-2, OrbView, Quickbird, and Resourcesat. Three geographically different cities are selected for this investigation: Mumbai and Ahmedabad, India and Kigali, Rwanda. The exploration of the utility and transferability of the GLCM shows that the variance of the GLCM combined with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is able to separate slums and formal areas. The overall accuracy achieved is 84\% in Kigali, 87\% in Mumbai, and 88\% in Ahmedabad. Furthermore, combining spectral information with the GLCM variance within a random forest classifier results in a pixel-based classification accuracy of 90\%. The final slum map, aggregated to homogenous urban patches (HUPs), shows an accuracy of 88\%-95\% for slum locations depending on the scale parameter.},

As expected, cities spread out when they are richer, more populated, and when transportation or farmland is cheaper. Respectively 100\% and 87\% of the cities exhibit the expected negative density and rent gradients: on average, a 1\% decrease in income net of transportation costs leads to a 21\% decrease in densities and a 3\% decrease in rents per m2. We also investigate the heterogeneity between cities of different characteristics in terms of monocentricity, informality, and amenities.},

Classifications representing the LCCS Level 3 taxonomy (8 categories representing semi-(natural) and/or cultivated/managed vegetation or natural or artificial bare or water bodies) were generated for two time periods and across four test sites located in the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales. This was achieved by progressively and hierarchically combining existing time-static layers relating to (a) the extent of artificial surfaces (urban, water) and agriculture and (b) annual summaries of EVs relating to the extent of vegetation (fractional cover) and water (hydroperiod, intertidal area, mangroves) generated through DEA. More detailed classifications that integrated information on, for example, forest structure (based on vegetation cover (\%) and height (m); time-static for 2009) and hydroperiod (months), were subsequently produced for each time-step. The overall accuracies of the land cover classifications were dependent upon those reported for the individual input layers, with these ranging from 80\% (for cultivated, urban and artificial water) to over 95\% (for hydroperiod and fractional cover). The changes identified include mangrove dieback in the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria and reduced dam water levels and an associated expansion of vegetation in Lake Ross, Burdekin. The extent of detected changes corresponded with those observed using time-series of RapidEye data (2014 to 2016; for the Gulf of Carpentaria) and Google Earth imagery (2009--2016 for Lake Ross). This use case demonstrates the capacity and a conceptual framework to implement EODESM within DEA and provides countries using the Open Data Cube (ODC) environment with the opportunity to routinely generate land cover maps from Landsat or Sentinel-1/2 data, at least annually, using a consistent and internationally recognised taxonomy.},

The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon causes increased temperatures in urban areas compared to outlying regions. It is considered one of the main anthropogenic climate modifications and is directly linked to land-use patterns. The objective of this study was to analyze the presence of the UHI effect, diurnal and nocturnal, in the dry season in 21 Brazilian metropolitan areas from 2000 to 2016. Surface temperature, mean albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values generated by the MODIS sensor (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) were used. The results obtained showed substantial differences between diurnal and nocturnal UHI effects. Manaus, Porto Alegre, Bel{\'e}m, and Recife presented the highest values of diurnal UHI, whereas Curitiba, Bras{\'i}lia, S{\~a}o Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro showed higher heat island effects at night. The results are an alert to policymakers of the need to rethink land occupation regulations and also give support to actions to mitigate the phenomenon.}

The achievement of development goals, such as the Sustainable Development Goals, requires access to up-to-date information on informal settlements. This review provides an overview of studies that used object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques to detect informal settlements using remotely sensed data. This paper focuses on three main aspects: image processing steps followed when detecting informal settlements using OBIA; informal settlement indicators and image-based proxies used to detect informal settlements; and a review of studies that extracted and analyzed informal settlement land use objects. The success of OBIA in detecting informal settlements depends on the understanding and selection of informal settlement indicators and image-based proxies used during image classification. To meet the local ontology of informal settlements, the transfer of OBIA mapping techniques requires the fine-tuning of the rulesets. Machine learning OBIA techniques using image proxies derived from multiple sensors increase the opportunities for detecting informal settlements on the city or national level.},

In places along island coasts where shoreline recession is particularly noticeable and/or its impacts most severe, perhaps because adjacent population densities are unusually high, a common response has been to build a seawall. While this solution may appear instinctively correct, studies suggest otherwise, even to the point where seawall construction, particularly outside urban areas, might be considered maladaptive -- neither solving the intended problem in the short-term nor helping coastal peoples cope effectively with longer-term shoreline change. Seawall construction can be viewed as part of a broader group of maladaptive solutions that are uncritically embraced by island peoples who may judge the efficacy of these solutions by their success in (wealthier) continental or urban contexts. More effective and sustainable approaches involve nature-based solutions in the short term and planning for transformative responses involving relocation in the longer term.},

  abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a geospatial processing platform based on geo-information applications in the `cloud'. This platform provides free access to huge volumes of satellite data for computing, and offers support tools to monitor and analyse environmental features on a large scale. Such facilities have been widely used in numerous studies about land management and planning. Considering the current lack of relevant overviews, it may be useful to evaluate the utilization paths of GEE and its impact on the scientific community. For this purpose, a systematic review has been conducted using the PRISMA methodology based on 343 articles published from 2020 to 2022 in high-impact scientific journals, selected from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. After an overview of the publishing context, an analysis of the frequency of satellite features, processing methods, applications are carried out, and a special attention is given to the COVID-19 studies. Finally, the geographical distribution of the reviewed articles is evaluated, and the citation impact metrics is analysed. On a bibliometric approach, 90 journals published articles on GEE in the reference period (January 2020 to April 2022), and this large number of journals reveals the multidisciplinary application of GEE platform as well as the interest of publishers towards this topic of relevance for the international scientific community. The results of the meta-analysis following the systematic review showed that: (i) the Landsat 8 was the most widely-used satellite (25\%); (i) the non-parametric classification methods, mainly Random Forest, were the most recurrent algorithms (31\%); and (iii) the water resources assessment and prediction were the most common methodological applications (22\%). A low number of articles about COVID-19, in spite of the planetary importance of the pandemic effects. The reviewed articles were geographically distributed among 86 countries, China, United States, and India accounting for the large number. `Remote Sensing' and `Remote Sensing of Environment' were the leading journals in the citation impact metrics, while the Random Forest method and the agriculture-related applications being the mostly cited. It is expected that these results might change over the mid to long term, due to fast progress in environmental and spatial information technologies, although currently our findings may be worthwhile and useful for assessing the current global deployment of GEE platform.},

We found that: (1) SVM and NB were superior to CART and KNN, and both could achieve high classification accuracy ({$>$}90\%); (2) the setting of tuning parameters greatly affected classification accuracy, particularly for the most commonly-used SVM classifier; the optimal values of tuning parameters might vary slightly with the size of training samples;  (3) the size of training sample also greatly affected the classification accuracy, when the size of training sample was less than 125. Increasing the size of training samples generally led to the increase of classification accuracies for all four classifiers. In addition, NB and KNN were more sensitive to the sample sizes. This research provides insights into the selection of classifiers and the size of training samples. It also highlights the importance of the appropriate setting of tuning parameters for different machine learning classifiers and provides useful information for optimizing these parameters.},

In this article, we explore the capability of short-term property rental data to identify neighbourhoods where change is occurring. The article focuses on the relationship between data from the Airbnb platform and gentrification. Through a study in Dublin, Ireland, Airbnb data was analysed using state-of-the-art Emerging Hotspot Analysis to identify locations with high potential to experience gentrification and areas that have undergone recent development. The locations identified by the method are correlated with gentrification and neighbourhood change described in other literature. The spatiotemporal approach reveals more about locational changes in the city than other methods, which focus only on one component, such as space or time. The study highlights the importance of access to real estate market data, such as data about the short-term rental market, to extract spatiotemporal changes occurring in neighbourhoods. The results contribute to the discourse on the impacts of short-term rental and Airbnb on cities and can be used by policymakers, observers, and citizens to motivate the distribution of services. The question as to whether gentrification or Airbnb came first remains an open one.},

Our home-level analysis uses data from 2,786,895 homes for sale and 267,486 homes for rent to study the impact of the distance from the nearest university or hospital to individual home prices. While our results generally agree with our expectations that larger, closer institutions yield higher prices, we also find some interesting results that challenge these expectations, such as positive correlations between volatility and university/hospital size in some ZIP codes, a positive correlation between rent and distance from a hospital for some homes, and lower correlations of rent vs. distance from a university compared to price vs. distance.}

  abstract = {Support vector machine (SVM) was applied for land-cover characterization using MODIS time-series data. Classification performance was examined with respect to training sample size, sample variability, and landscape homogeneity (purity). The results were compared to two conventional nonparametric image classification algorithms: multilayer perceptron neural networks (NN) and classification and regression trees (CART). For 2001 MODIS time-series data, SVM generated overall accuracies ranging from 77\% to 80\% for training sample sizes from 20 to 800 pixels per class, compared to 67--76\% and 62--73\% for NN and CART, respectively. These results indicated that SVM's had superior generalization capability, particularly with respect to small training sample sizes. There was also less variability of SVM performance when classification trials were repeated using different training sets. Additionally, classification accuracies were directly related to sample homogeneity/heterogeneity. The overall accuracies for the SVM algorithm were 91\% (Kappa=0.77) and 64\% (Kappa=0.34) for homogeneous and heterogeneous pixels, respectively. The inclusion of heterogeneous pixels in the training sample did not increase overall accuracies. Also, the SVM performance was examined for the classification of multiple year MODIS time-series data at annual intervals. Finally, using only the SVM output values, a method was developed to directly classify pixel purity. Approximately 65\% of pixels within the Albemarle--Pamlico Basin study area were labeled as ``functionally homogeneous'' with an overall classification accuracy of 91\% (Kappa=0.79). The results indicated a high potential for regional scale operational land-cover characterization applications.},

However, previous studies have shown that the SRTM DEM is systematically higher than the actual land surface in vegetated mountain areas. The objective of this study is to propose a procedure to calibrate the SRTM DEM over large vegetated mountain areas. Firstly, we developed methods to estimate canopy cover from aerial imagery and tree height from multi-source datasets (i.e., field observations, airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data, Landsat TM imagery, climate surfaces, and topographic data). Then, the airborne LiDAR derived DEM, covering {\textasciitilde}5\% of the study area, was used to evaluate the accuracy of the SRTM DEM. Finally, a regression model of the SRTM DEM error depending on tree height, canopy cover, and terrain slope was developed to calibrate the SRTM DEM. Our results show that the proposed procedure can significantly improve the accuracy of the SRTM DEM over vegetated mountain areas. The mean difference between the SRTM DEM and the LiDAR DEM decreased from 12.15 m to -0.82 m, and the standard deviation dropped by 2 m.},

  abstract = {The decreasing area of mangroves is an ongoing problem since, between 1980 and 2005, one-third of the world's mangroves were lost. Rehabilitation and restoration strategies are required to address this situation. However, mangroves do not always respond well to these strategies and have high mortality due to several growth limiting parameters. This study developed a land suitability map for new mangrove plantations in different Southeast Asian countries for both current and future climates at a 250-m resolution. Hydrodynamic, geomorphological, climatic, and socio-economic parameters and three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) for 2050 and 2070 with two global climate model datasets (the Centre National de Recherches M{\'e}t{\'e}orologiques Climate model version 5 [CNRM-CM5.1] and the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate [MIROC5]) were used to predict suitable areas for mangrove planting. An analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to determine the level of importance for each parameter. To test the accuracy of the results, the mangrove land suitability analysis were further compared using different weights in every parameter. The sensitivity test using the Wilcoxon test was also carried out to test which variables had changed with the first weight and the AHP weight. The land suitability products from this study were compared with those from previous studies. The differences in land suitability for each country in Southeast Asia in 2050 and 2070 to analyze the differences in each RCP scenario and their effects on the mangrove land suitability were also assessed. Currently, there is 398,000 ha of potentially suitable land for mangrove planting in Southeast Asia, and this study shows that it will increase between now and 2070. Indonesia account for 67.34\% of the total land area in the ``very suitable'' and ``suitable'' class categories. The RCP 8.5 scenario in 2070, with both the MIROC5 and CNRM-CM5.1 models, resulted in the largest area of a ``very suitable'' class category for mangrove planting. This study provides information for the migration of mangrove forests to the land, alleviating many drawbacks, especially for ecosystems.},

Therefore, excessive groundwater abstraction has caused serious land subsidence over the last few decades. This study proposed the priority areas for piped water supply extension to alleviate the adverse effects of groundwater over-abstraction in DKI Jakarta. Water consumption and multilayer analyses (e.g., geology, groundwater abstraction, groundwater level, piped water coverage, and groundwater quality) were carried out to determine the priority areas for piped water development. Based on three parameters, namely the water demand--supply gap, land subsidence, and groundwater quality, the northern and western regions of Jakarta were selected as the priority areas for piped water development, followed by the southern and eastern regions. The demand for piped water by the population in the abovementioned priority areas is estimated to be 462,211 m3/d, while the total water demand of Jakarta is 1,878,899 m3/d, which is greater than the supply capacity of 1,747,440 m3/d from the existing water treatment plants. Therefore, the areas for controlled groundwater abstraction were also selected to augment the shortfall of the piped water supply capacity.},

This study focuses on the use of multitemporal C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to assess the results for forest type (FTY), between coniferous and deciduous forest, and tree species (SPP) classification. We also investigated the temporal stability through the use of backscatter from multiple seasons and years of acquisition. SAR acquisitions were pre-processed, histogram-matched, smoothed, and temperature-corrected. The normalized average backscatter was extracted for interpreted plots and used to train Random Forest models. The classification results were then validated with field plots. A principal component analysis was tested to reduce the dimensionality of the explanatory variables, which generally improved the results. Overall, the FTY classifications were promising, with higher accuracies (OA of 0.94 and K = 0.86) than the SPP classification (OA of 0.66 and K = 0.54). The use of merely winter images (OA = 0.89) reached, on average, results that were almost as good as those using of images from the entire year. The use of images from a single winter season reached a similar result (OA = 0.87). We conclude that multiple Sentinel-1 images acquired in winter conditions are feasible to classify forest types in a hemi-boreal Swedish forest.},

In 2018, a tsunami occurred in the Sunda Strait due to the eruption of the Anak Krakatau Volcano, which caused many fatalities and much building damage. This study aimed to detect the building damage in the Labuan District, Banten Province. Machine learning methods were used to detect building damage using random forest with object-based techniques. No previous research has combined selected predictors into scenarios; hence, the novelty of this study is combining various random forest predictors to identify the extent of building damage using 14 predictor scenarios. In addition, field surveys were conducted two years and nine months after the tsunami to observe the changes and efforts made. The results of the random forest classification were validated and compared with three datasets, namely xBD, Copernicus, and field survey data. The results of this study can help classify the level of building damage using satellite imagery to improve mitigation in tsunami-prone areas.},

DInSAR uses radar images to measure centimeter-level surface displacements. In the images, ground resolution can be relatively high, with each data point (pixel) representing the average displacement over an area of several square meters. The image data are acquired regularly which allows subsidence to be monitored sequentially over short periods; imaging periods typically range from weeks to months. Monitoring subsidence over short periods with high spatial resolution has potential to provide insight into the dynamics of subsidence and into relationships between mine advance and subsidence. In this study, for three longwall mines in the western United States, initial subsidence occurring at the start of longwall advance is quantified over short periods (12--72~days). C-band interferometric wide swath Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel satellites are used to quantify the subsidence. Overall, the data show initial development of subsidence, expansion of the subsidence trough, and the advance of subsidence in the direction of mining.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of urban park configuration on the Land Surface Temperature of the park and adjacent areas. In urban parks, the study analyzed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and the Land Surface Temperature (LST). The NDVI categorization process resulted in the development of a vegetation density distribution. The majority of Medan's urban areas were categorized as low density, as seen by their low NDVI values. The NDBI values were significantly higher in the majority of the area. This shows that the majority of places are experiencing a decline in vegetation cover. The density of vegetation varies according to the placement of park components such as trees, mixed plants, recreation, and sports areas. According to LST data, the temperature in the urban park was cooler than in the surrounding areas. Although the surrounding areas are densely populated, urban parks are dominated by trees. Additionally, there is a green space adjacent to the park, which is a green lane that runs alongside the main roadways.},

  abstract = {Earth system science has changed rapidly due to global environmental changes and the advent of Earth observation technology. Therefore, new tools are required to monitor, measure, analyze, evaluate, and model Earth observation data. Google Earth (GE) was officially launched by Google in 2005 as a ''geobrowser'', and Google Earth Engine (GEE) was released in 2010 as a cloud computing platform with substantial computational capabilities. The use of these two tools or platforms in various applications, particularly as used by the remote sensing community, has developed rapidly. In this paper, we reviewed the applications and trends in the use of GE and GEE by analyzing peer-reviewed articles, dating up to January 2021, in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection using scientometric analysis (i.e., by using CiteSpace) and meta-analysis. We found the following: (1) the number of articles describing the use of GE or GEE increased substantially from two in 2006 to 530 in 2020. The number of GEE articles increased much faster than those concerned with the use of GE. (2) Both GE and GEE were extensively used by the remote sensing community as multidisciplinary tools. GE articles covered a broader range of research areas (e.g., biology, education, disease and health, economic, and information science) and appeared in a broader range of journals than those concerned with the use of GEE. (3) GE and GEE shared similar keywords (e.g., ``land cover'', ``water'', ``model'', ``vegetation'', and ``forest''), which indicates that their application is of great importance in certain research areas. The main difference was that articles describing the use of GE emphasized its use as a visual display platform, while those concerned with GEE placed more emphasis on big data and time-series analysis. (4) Most applications of GE and GEE were undertaken in countries, such as the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. (5) GEE is an important tool for analysis, whereas GE is used as an auxiliary tool for visualization. Finally, in this paper, the merits and limitations of GE and GEE, and recommendations for further improvements, are summarized from an Earth system science perspective.},

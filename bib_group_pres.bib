  abstract = {Land subsidence is identified as a global problem and intensive studies are being conducted worldwide to detect and monitor risk of this problem. Risk assessment of land subsidence is simply an evaluation of the probability and frequency of occurrence of land subsidence, exposure of people and property to the subsidence and consequence of that exposure. Remote sensing technology was used to extract information of land subsidence in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Also, Disaster Risk Index method and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) along with Geographic Information System (GIS) tools were used to assess risk of land subsidence in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Subsidence volume for locations Central Kathmandu, Chauni, Lalitpur, Imadol, Thimi, Madhyaour Thimi, New Baneshwor, Koteshwor and Gothatar was calculated using a simple mathematical formula. The subsidence depth for these locations was found to be in a range of 1 cm to 17 cm and the maximum subsidence velocity was found to be 4.8 cm/yr. This study revealed that the location where maximum subsidence was observed (i.e. Central Kathmandu and Lalitpur) was found to be at high risk of experiencing land subsidence induced damage. Other location where subsidence was observed was found to be at medium risk and the rest of the Kathmandu valley was found to be at low risk with current data situation. This study can be considered as the first step towards other comprehensive study relating to land subsidence risk assessment. The outcome of this research provides a basic understanding of the current situation that can further assist in developing prevention and risk management techniques.},

  abstract = {Most published studies identify groundwater extraction as the leading cause of land subsidence (LS). However, the causes of LS are not only attributable to groundwater extraction. Other land-use practices can also affect the occurrence of LS. In this study, radar interferometric techniques and machine learning (ML) models were used for the prediction, susceptibility zoning, and prioritization of influential variables in the occurrence of LS in the Bakhtegan basin. The LS rate was characterized by applying an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). The recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was used to detect and select the dominant combination of indicators to prepare an LS susceptibility map. Three ML models, including random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and classification and regression trees (CART), were used to develop predictive models. All three models had acceptable performance. Among the ML models, the RF model performed the best (i.e., Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency, Kling--Gupta efficiency, correlation coefficient, and percent bias metrics of 0.76, 0.78, 0.88, and 0.70 for validating phase, respectively). The analysis conducted on all three ML model outputs showed that high and very high LS susceptibility classes were located on or near irrigated agricultural land. The results indicate that the leading cause of land LS in the study region is not due to groundwater withdrawals. Instead, the distance from dams and the proximity to anticlines, faults, and mines are the most important identifiers of LS susceptibility. Additionally, the highest probability of LS susceptibility was found at distances less than 18 km from synclines, 6 to 13 km from anticlines, 23 km from dams, and distances less than 20 to more than 144 km from mines. The validated methods presented in this study are reproducible, transferrable, and recommended for mapping LS susceptibility in semiarid and arid climate zones with similar environmental conditions.},

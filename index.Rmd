# The significance of Jakarta

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[Jakarta as capital]

* Jakarta is home to significant financial institutions like the Indonesia Stock Exchange and the Bank of Indonesia, along with serving as the corporate headquarters for numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations. This underscores its pivotal role in the country's economy.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Area]

* The area of Jakarta is 661.5km2 and is divided to five administrative cities of South Jakarta, Central Jakarta, East Jakarta, West Jakarta, and North Jakarta.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Population]

* Total population is 10 million within the city, while the total population of the entire metro area is 30 million.

## Highlighting the problem 

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[The Sinking Capital]

* Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, has been at risk of becoming the first megacity to completely sink. This is attributed to factors such as rising sea levels, land subsidence, construction on soft sediments, and natural sediment compaction. 

* The northern part of Jakarta currently sits approximately 2.5 meters below sea level, with estimates indicating that by 2050, 40% of the area will be sunk. Each year, Jakarta experiences between 1 to 10 sinking incidents. 

]

.panel[.panel-name[NCICD]

* To protect Jakarta from coastal flooding, the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCID) was developed, with the main plan surrounding the construction of a sea wall which could reach 32km in length `r Citet(myBib,"GiantSeaWall")`.



]

.panel[.panel-name[The Main Cause]

* Land subsidence in Jakarta displays spatial and temporal variations, typically occurring at rates of approximately 3 to 10 centimetre's per year. 

* Currently, detailed understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms of land subsidence in Jakarta, both spatially and temporally, remains incomplete. 

* Accurately estimating and modelling the contribution of each causative factor to observed land subsidence in specific areas is still necessary.

## Causes of Subsidence

.pull-left[
* Physical factors: earthquakes. Indonesia is located on destructive plate boundaries where earthquakes happen frequently (Bott et al., 2021).

* Human/ social factors: groundwater extraction, rapid urban development, improper agricultural practices (Adibin et al., 2011)

* Natural consolidation of alluvium soil, load of infrastructures and constructions, and tectonic activities

## Impact of land subsidence  

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Infrastructure]

* Cracking of permanent constructions and roads.

* Tilting of houses and buildings.

* “Sinking” of houses and buildings.

* Breaking of underground pipelines and utilities.

* Malfunction of sewerage and drainage system 
 
* Deterioration in function of building and infrastructures

]

.panel[.panel-name[Environment]

* Changes in river canal and drain flow systems indirect.

* Frequent coastal flooding.

* Wider expansion of flooding areas. 

* Inundated areas and infrastructures.

* Increased inland sea water intrusion.

* Deterioration in quality of environmental condition

]

.panel[.panel-name[Economic]

* Increase in maintenance cost of infrastructure.

* decrease in land and property values.

* Abandoned buildings and facilities.

* Disruption to economic activities
]

.panel[.panel-name[Social]

* Deterioration in quality of living environment and life health and 

* Possibility of seawater intrusion to the lowered groundwater table, thus lack of clean water supply


* Disruption to daily activities of people.

## Benefits to Addressing Land Subsidence

- Reduced loss of land.

- Reduced damage to infrastructure such as roads and buildings.

- Reduced flood risk.

- Protection of businesses and industry such as coastal tourism. 

- To ensure clean groundwater supply by avoiding seawater intrusion to groundwater table

---
## Criticism to the wall approach
.pull-left[
* Sea wall requires frequent maintenance from coastal erosion and destroy the natural landscape of Jakarta Bay (Nunn et al., 2021)

* It can only provide coastal defense but it’s unable to solve the root cause of the problem which is land subsidence.

* High cost of construction and maintenance. 

* Sea wall may create conflict with the dynamic coastal nature and block the sediment exchange between land and sea.
]

.pull-right[

* Can disrupt natural shoreline  processes and ruin coastal habitats such as mangrove and intertidal beaches.

* The build of the sea wall can have a terrible impact on the socio-economic aspect of Jakarta city.

## Objectives

- Support the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development Project by providing data-driven monitoring and improved decision-making on land subsidence.

  - Producing a land subsidence susceptibility map for better monitoring
  - Producing a land subsidence risk map to help tackle problem areas
  
- Using these products:

  - Identify areas that require careful monitoring and deployment of continuous global positioning systems. 
  - Provide evidence-based recommended action on sustainable water management and infrastructure zoning.
  - Comply with relevant national and international policies to intervene as appropriate.

## Methodology: Workflow

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='95%', fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics('methodology_workflow.png')

```

---
## Methodology: Identifying Monitoring Areas

1. Split the remotely sensed data on previous land subsidence and influential environmental factors into training (70%) and testing (30%).

1. Preprocess the data including building raster maps for each variable. 

1. Employ Random Forest algorithm with cross validation to map land subsidence susceptibility.

1. Perform a permutation feature importance analysis to measure the contribution of each feature to the model.

1. Validate the model using the testing data. 

1. Map out land subsidence susceptibility that identifies areas of very high, high, moderate, low and very low susceptibility. 

---
## Methodology: Risk Mapping 

1. Preprocess land subsidence and social data to create raster maps.

1. Use Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to calculate relative weights on both the land subsidence data and social data to indicate hazard and vulnerability. 

1. Produce hazard and vulnerability maps using the calculated weights. 

1. Combine hazard and vulnerability maps by producing a risk index.

1. Using risk index, produce a risk map showing areas at very high risk, high risk, moderate risk, low risk and very low risk.
